# **App Name**: Github Explorer

## Core Features:

- Trending Repositories Display: Display trending Github repositories, sourced from the Github Trending API
- Language Filtering: Filter repositories by programming language.
- Repository Details: Show repository details: name, description, number of stars, and a link to the Github repository.
- AI repository summarization: Use a generative AI tool to summarize the content of the Github page for each displayed repository. Use heuristics to determine whether a README exists or to summarize other prominent documentation if present, for instance, from the landing page itself.
- Search Functionality: Search for Github repositories based on keywords, sorting by relevance, stars, or updated date.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #3B82F6 (a moderate blue) to give a sense of trust, openness, and technical skill.
- Background color: #E5E7EB (a very light grey) for a clean, uncluttered canvas.
- Accent color: #6366F1 (a brighter indigo) for emphasis on interactive elements and call-to-action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look. Good for headlines and body text
- Use simple, outline-style icons for navigation and repository actions, maintaining a consistent visual language throughout the application.
- Employ a card-based layout for displaying repositories, ensuring information is easily scannable and visually appealing.
- Incorporate subtle animations, like fading transitions when displaying repository details or loading new content, to enhance user experience.
